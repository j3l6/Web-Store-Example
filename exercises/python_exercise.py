# Product and DigitalProduct Exercise
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Implement a class `Product` with:
#    - Constructor: takes `name` (str) and `price` (float)
#    - Method: `get_discounted_price(discount_rate)` returns the price after applying the given discount rate (e.g., 0.2 for 20% off), rounded to 2 decimals
# 2. Implement a class `DigitalProduct` that inherits from `Product`:
#    - Overrides `get_discounted_price()` (no arguments) to always return the price with a fixed 20% discount, rounded to 2 decimals

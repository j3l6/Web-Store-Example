# XML/XPath Exercise
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Implement a function named `modify_xml` that:
#    - Parses the XML file `input_form.xml` (provided in this directory).
#    - Locates the `<field name="author"/>` element and moves it to be the first child of the root `<form>` element.
#    - Adds a new `<section>` element with the text "Details" after the fields.
#    - Adds a `<button>` element with the attribute `name="toggle_availability"` after the section.
#    - Outputs the modified XML as `output_form.xml`.
#
